########## 1 - Solving the SI model using deSolve
# The code below will solve the SI model with beta = 0.4 over 50 days with
# initial conditions S(0) = 99, I(0) = 1. Run the following lines including the 
# plot() line to create a plot of the output

  # Define differential equations
  dS <- - (beta * S * I) / N

}

# Define parameter values

# a) Increase the initial number of infected individuals, what happens to the output?
# Answer:

# b) What does the 'by' argument in the 'times' vector represent?

########## 2 - Solving the SIR model using deSolve

# Now, let's solve a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered set of ordinary equations.
# There are now states;  Susceptible, Infected, Recovered
# Once infected people recover at a rate gamma = 0.1
# The code for the model function ONLY is given below.

# Define model function 
SIR_model <- function(times, state, parms){
  ## Define variables
  S <- state["S"]
  I <- state["I"]
  R <- state["R"]
  N <- S + I + R
  # Extract parameters
  beta <- parms["beta"]
  gamma <- parms["gamma"]
  # Define differential equations
  dS <- - (beta * S * I) / N
  dI <- (beta * S * I) / N - gamma * I
  dR <- gamma * I
  res <- list(c(dS, dI, dR ))
  return(res)
}

# a) To solve this model, you need to write a new vector of parameters and of state variables
# You can assume that there are no recovered individuals at time 0 and 1 infected
# Plot the output of the SIR model with different colours for 
# Susceptible, Infected and Recovered individuals

########## 3 - Solving the SEIR model using deSolve

# The code below has been written to solve a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered model.
# In the model individuals can be in one of four states
# Once infected, susceptible individuals move to the exposed class
# Exposed individuals become infectious at a rate delta = 0.14

########## Optional questions 
########## 4 - Adding vaccination to the SIR model

# a) Extend the SIR model to include a vaccinated class. 
# Here we assume that susceptible individuals are vaccinated at a rate v = 0.05
# The vaccine is 100% effective, so once vaccinated, individuals cannot become infected

# HINT: you will need to create a new class V, you can assume that the initial 
# number of vaccinated individuals is 0
