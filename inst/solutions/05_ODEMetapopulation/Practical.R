## A.
# When you simulate the above model, you'll notice that currently the epidemics are nearly identical in the two populations.
# Update the model parameters so the transmission rate between the two populations is equal to 5% of the transmission rate within each population.
# What happens to the size and timing of the epidemics?

# Answer: Epidemic is delayed with slightly smaller peak in population 2 because takes time for infection to spread.

parameters <- c( beta = 0.4, gamma = 0.1, alpha = 0.05)

## B. What happens if the epidemic starts with 10 people infected in both populations? Why does this happen?

# Answer: Epidemics are identical because initial conditions are the same.
# Although there is some connectivity between populations, it is symmetrical, so same dynamics in both.


## C.
# The model is currently set up to record the number of cumulative cases in each population (i.e. C1 and C2)
# The below code will plot these cumulative numbers of cases
# Update the code so you are plotting incidence, i.e. new cases appearing over time, rather than cumulative cases

#Hint: There are several ways to do this - some are easier than others.


# E. If you have time, expand the model to include three populations (denoted 1, 2, 3).
# How would you model an epidemic where:
#  - mixing between population 1 and population 2 is 5% of the rate of mixing within these populations
#  - mixing between population 1 and population 3 is 10% of the rate of mixing within these populations
#  - there is no mixing between population 2 and population 3
